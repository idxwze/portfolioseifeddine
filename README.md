# Portfolio - Seifeddine Reguige

Academic portfolio developed as part of **SEG3525 – User Interface Design and Analysis**.

This website presents my academic background, technical skills, work methodology, and selected projects through a clean, structured, and responsive user interface.

## Overview

The portfolio is designed as a single-page website with dedicated project case study pages.  
The focus is on clarity, readability, and consistency rather than heavy visual effects.

Main sections include:
- About
- Method / Process
- Projects
- Experience
- Contact

The interface supports both **English and French**, as well as **light and dark modes**.

- Simple and consistent typography
- Clear visual hierarchy using spacing and sectioning
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap’s grid system
- Subtle transitions and animations to guide navigation
- Accessibility-focused structure and contrast
