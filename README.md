# Portfolio - Seifeddine Reguige

Academic portfolio developed as part of **SEG3525 - User Interface Design and Analysis**.

This website presents my academic background, technical skills, work methodology, and selected projects through a clean, structured, and responsive interface.

## Overview

The portfolio is built around a main home page with dedicated case-study pages.
The focus is clarity, readability, accessibility, and maintainable front-end code.

Main sections:
- About
- Method / Process
- Projects
- Experience
- Contact

The interface supports both **English and French**, as well as **light and dark modes**.

- `assets/`: images and CV

## Notes

- Project pages reuse the same global CSS and JS as the home page.
- If a page is not fully translated in both languages, the language toggle is hidden to avoid partial UI translation.
